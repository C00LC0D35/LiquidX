## Setting up a Workspace
LiquidX uses Gradle, to make sure that it is installed properly you can check [Gradle's website](https://gradle.org/install/).
1. Clone the repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PrahXZ/LiquidX.git`. 
2. CD into the local repository folder.
3. If you are using Intelij run the following command `gradlew setupDevWorkspace idea genIntellijRuns build`
4. Open the folder as a Gradle project in your IDE. (Make sure that your IDE is using Java 8, if not then it will have issues)
5. Select the Forge run configuration.
